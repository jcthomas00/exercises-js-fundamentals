    Before you go Googling, get out a piece of paper and draw some triangles.

    If you draw two sides of length A and B, are there values of a potential
    third length (C) that make it impossible to form a triangle?

    If the problem is still to hard, simplify even more. What if you draw two
    side of the same length? Imagine the angle between the two sides increasing
    from 0º and you drawing the third side. What's the largest this third side
    could ever be?
